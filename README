Some tools for managing Cisco routers.

watch-switch-config.pl: Works with rsyslog to watch for config changes, intitiates a tftp and commits changes to SVN
   watch-switch-config: init.d script for starting config watcher
    snmp-get-config.pl: Uses SNMP to force a tftp push of a config file
    snmp-put-config.pl: Uses SNMP to upload a chunk of config to the running config of a router.
                  vim/: VIM Syntax highlighting for cisco router configs. 

These scripts use SNMP to trigger cisco configuration push/pull rather than
scripted SSH/telnet.

CISCO-CONFI-COPY-MIB (and CISCO-SMI) MIBs must be installed. 
You will also need a working TFTP server amd an SVN server to commit changes to.

The watcher requires rsyslog to be configured to pass the relevant logs to a FIFO, this depends
on your logging config but should look something like this:

local6.*      |/var/run/watch-switch-config.fifo
